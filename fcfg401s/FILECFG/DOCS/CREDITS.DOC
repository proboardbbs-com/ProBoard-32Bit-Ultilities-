This is the 'Credits.Doc' file for FileCFG's Source Distribution.

This program uses the following swapping module:

	SPAWNO v4.0   EMS/XMS/disk swapping replacement for spawn...()
	(c) Copyright 1990, 1991 Ralf Brown  All Rights Reserved.
	May be freely copied provided that this copyright notice is
	not altered or removed.

I have only included the large model library and the header file needed
for the compilation. This module is very popular and you should be able
to find it easily. Look on the programming site:

							fpt://x2ftp.oulu.fi

Also, I have used the following routines, which are either public domain
or copyrighted but freely distributable:

	Barnaby W. Falls' progress indicator class for TuboVision. It can be
found as TPROGB.* in the TV section of the Borland's forum on CompuServe.
I have compiled the source into PB-Lib itself.

	David Baldwin's TCombo and TInputLong classes (with little adaptations).
These are distributed in source form with his excellent Dialog Design v4.6
program. Also available on the Borland's CompuServe forum, in the TurboVision
file section. I have compiled these modules (modified) into PB-Lib itself.

I have also adapted Borland's TChDirDialog source code to make the class
which obtains a directory path. Only minor modifications were required. I
have compiled the new class as TGetDirDialog in PB-Lib itself.
