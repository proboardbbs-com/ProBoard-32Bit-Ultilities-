To compile the overlay version of FileCFG, you will need to use the
FileCFGO.Prj file. It defines the __OVERLAY constant and also sets
all the necessary compiler options.

You will need to get the overlay version of PB-Lib (all the three
modules). If you do have the source, you will need to read the instructions
that are provided in it in order to be able to build the correct version.

Generally, the Build.Bat provided with PB-Lib can build all the necessary
libraries for you. Use the following commands to generate the overlay
versions:

		build -o			; generate PBLIB_OV.LIB (PB-Lib)
		build -o -c			; generate PBLCS_OV.LIB (Class libraries)
		build -o -v			; generate PBVIS_OV.LIB (TurboVision add-ons)

They will be placed in the correct %SILICON%\LIB directory. If you installed
the source code in %SILICON%\SRC\FILECFG, then you do not have to make any
modifications to the project files except adjusting the include directories.

FileCFG compiles without any warnings or errors in both normal and overlay
modes. This is with all warnings turned on (except the Superflous & with a
function, which is necessary to prevent problems with TurboVision itself).

Apart from the overlay versions of the PB-Lib modules, you will need an
overlay version of TurboVision. You will need to have access to the source
code (it came with Borland C++ 3.1 with Application Frameworks) and TASM.
Of course, if you have BC++ 3.1 w/ AF, then you already have those and you
need to go to the TurboVision source directory and type:

					make -DNDEBUG -DOVERLAY

This will build the overlay version. Note that this will replace the TV.LIB
file in the .\LIB directory, so make sure you back it up first. I have
included the full text of the Borland's own instructions on overlaying
TurboVision. I followed them exactly and they do work. With FileCFG, the
two new resulting modules are called TVOVL.LIB and TVNO.LIB for the overlaid
modules and the interrupt handlers respectively.

========================= Overlaying Turbo Vision ==========================

BACKGROUND
==========

In order to create an overlaid Turbo Vision program, one must have the
Turbo Vision Source code and a copy of Turbo Assembler (v2.5x, or above).
If you have problems with the assembler running out of memory, download
TI1331, which will explain how to run TASMX, the DPMI protected mode
assembler, from the IDE or from BCC.


OVERVIEW
========

1. Rebuild the Turbo Vision Library to include overlay support and move
   certain non-overlayable object modules to a second library.

2. Set up a project file for the overlaid program and make sure that all the
   correct options are set for overlaid program, including -Vs and -B. If you
   prefer using the command line tools, you can create an analogous Makefile.

3. Add TV.LIB and the second library you created in step one, above, to the
   project and mark TV.LIB as overlayable.


REBUILDING FOR OVERLAYS
=======================

In order to use Turbo Vision in an overlaid program, TV.LIB must be rebuilt.
Change directory to the Turbo Vision Source code directory (ex. C:\BC\TV\SRC)
and run this command:

                            MAKE -B -DOVERLAY

This will generate a new copy of TV.LIB which can be overlayed. It will also
create two .OBJ files, SYSINT.OBJ and TEVENT.OBJ. These two files contain
code for TV's interrupt handlers and cannot be overlayed.  In addition,
there are a few other OBJ files still in the library which cannot be
overlaid either since they include code that could be called from Turbo
Vision's critical error handler.  These can be extracted from the library
with the following command:

	TLIB TV.LIB -*SYSERR -*TSCREEN -*DRIVERS -*DRIVERS2
				-*SWAPST -*TEVENT -*SYSINT

Create a new library called TVNO.LIB that consists of the aforementioned OBJ
files that should not be overlaid.  Use the following command to do this:

	TLIB TVNO.LIB -+TEVENT -+SYSINT -+TSCREEN -+SYSERR
				  -+DRIVERS -+DRIVERS2 -+SWAPST


SETTING UP THE PROJECT
======================

Create a project file that includes all the source modules and libraries used
by your program.

First, go to Options|Application and select <Dos Overlay>.  Then sure to set
the following options:

     Options|Compiler|Code Generation : Large Model
     Options|Compiler|Code Generation : Compile Via Assembler
     Options|Compiler|C++ Options : Local Virtual Tables
     Options|Linker|Libraries : Unmark Turbo Vision

Of course if there are any other options needed for the project, such as
<Word Alignment> or <Optimizations> set those at this time, as well as
marking the appropriate modules in the project to be overlaid or not as
desired.


OVERLAYING TV.LIB
=================

Now, add TV.LIB and TVNO.LIB to the project.  In their respective local
options screens, mark <Overlay This Module> for TV.LIB and leave it blank
for TVNO.LIB.  It is imperative that TVNO.LIB not be overlaid.

Now select <Compile | Build All> to build the program.


COMMAND LINE EQUIVALENTS
========================

If using a Makefile and the command line tools, the following
options for BCC are equivalent to the options listed in step 2:

     -Y, -Yo        Compile for Overlays
     -ml            Large Model
     -B             Compile Via Assembler
     -Vs            Local Virtual Tables

Your command line will look something like this:

     bcc -Vs -B -ml -Yo myfile.cpp -Yo- tvno.lib -Yo tv.lib


IMPORTANT!!
===========

Be sure to use the same BC switches outlined in the makefile when
compiling your source code to be overlayed with the new overlayed
Turbo Vision library! (i.e. use the -Vs and -B switches  -  In
the IDE use OPTIONS|COMPILER|C++ OPTIONS|LOCAL VIRTUAL TABLES
and  OPTIONS|COMPILER|CODE GENERATION|COMPILE VIA ASSEMBLER ).


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

If the assembler runs out of memory when assembling one of the
files built by the compiler, use TASMX, the protected mode
assembler, instead.  Download TI1331 for instructions on how to
set up the Assember Transfer item to call TASMX.

If warning "No stub for fixup at SEGMENT:XXXXh in module MODULE"
is generated, most likely not all modules in the project are
being compiled with -B and -Vs, or that the Turbo Vision library
was not compiled with overlay support.  Double check that the
steps in this document have all been followed correctly and
rebuild the program with <Compile | Build All>.


INCREASING PERFOMANCE
=====================

To improve performance of an overlaid Turbo Vision application it
may be helpful to increase the size of the global variable
__ovrbuffer to 0x2000 or greater.  This will set up an 128K
overlay buffer.


EXAMPLE
=======

Here are explicit instructions for overlaying the TVFORMS program
in TVISION\DEMOS.  These instructions assume that the Turbo
Vision library has been recompiled for Overlay support as
described above:

     - Change directory to \BORLANDC\TVISION\DEMOS
     - Run BC and open TVFORMS.PRJ as a project.
     - Make these changes:

		Options | Application : Choose DOS Overlaid.
		Options | Compiler | Code generation : Reset to Large Model
		Options | Compiler | Code generation : Select compile via Assembler
		Options | Compiler | C++ options : Select Local Virtual Tables
		Options | Linker | Libraries : Uncheck Turbo Vision

     - Add TV.LIB and TVNO.LIB to the project file.
     - In the project window, select TV.LIB and any other source
       module you wish to overlay.  On each, select the name, type
       <Ctrl-O> and mark <Overlay This Module> on the Local Menu
       Dialog that appears.
     - Do not overlay TVNO.LIB.
     - Selecting <Compile | Build All> will now build an overlaid
       version of TVFORMS.
