What's new in FileCFG?
----------------------

File handling
-------------
	Now every time you read in the original configuration, FileCFG will
	check for old backups and offer to remove them. You should answer
	'Yes' if you want correct operation. The backups will be created each
	time data is loaded (whenever you select 'Arrange' from the menu).
	This way, it is ensured that FileCFG will operate on current files
	only. When saving, a temporary file FILECFG.BKP will be created. It
	should be removed by the program, but if you happen to find it in the
	system directory, delete it (no harm).

Multiple directories per area
-----------------------------
	Added support for FA_nnn.CTL files. In ProBoard you can specify
	multiple directories per file area. The problem with the mechanism is
	that it requires the control file names to match the area numbers. You
	can easily see the mess that can be created when renumbering and
	shuffling areas around. Now FileCFG will keep track of the control
	files and will update both the file name and the entry in the file
	path for the appropriate areas. You need to have the external control
	files properly configured for this to work. If an area has a control
	file specification, but no file actually exists, the area will not be
	updated. Only areas with valid control files will be. As far as I
	know, FileCFG is currently the only program that supports this
	operation (PBDESK and PBMOVE don't).
