THIS IS A CLOSED BETA VERSION! DO NOT DISTRIBUTE!
(note this beta was not released to testers, internal use only)

Cosmetic changes
----------------
	Reworked the menu. Now the three external utilities are in their own
	submenu off the file maintenance.

	Moved the ProCFG setup to the System menu, now the file and message
	editing menus have their own customized ProCFG startup command that
	will take you straight to the file or message areas respectively.

Functional changes
------------------
	Added FILEUTIL.CTL (optional) file processing. This is a simple text
	file with programs to execute. A sample is included. Now you can run
	all the necessary updates right after you're through configuring the
	file areas. If this file does not exist, the option will be disabled.
	The FILEUTIL.CTL file is a text file with commands. Each command must
	be on a separate line. You must specify the full path and extension to
	the program. You can also specify the necessary parameters. FileCFG
	will change to the program's directory and execute the command there.
	You cannot have blank lines in the file. Each line is either a comment
	or a command line. A comment line will have ';' (semi-colon) as the
	first (and only the first) character. Please, refer to the included
	sample for a proposed setup.

	Added MESGUTIL.CTL which is the same as above except it is executed
	from the Message Area menu.

	Added the Message Area handling functions with limited global support
	for now. The file backup handling is the same as for the file area
	editing. The commands in the editor are more or less the same. Note
	that FileCFG will also update the 'reply to' board numbers if the
	original is different than 0. In case the 'reply-to' are no longer
	exists, this number will be set to zero (it is generally safer to
	assume that less harm will be done that way).

	Added message-base reindexing command to the message menu. Also added
	external program support via SILICON.INI file (refer to the section in
	README!.á02 about this file). The keywords are still under the
	[FileCFG] header and here are the new ones:

					[FileCFG]
					InterEcho=D:\IM\IESETUP.EXE
					IEMenu=InterEcho ~s~etup

	Of course, it doesn't have to be InterEcho. This can be any program
	and name you want. You just need to use the keywords above. If the
	entry is missing and/or the program is not available, you won't be
	able to select this option.
