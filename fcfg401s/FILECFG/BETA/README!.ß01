THIS IS A CLOSED BETA VERSION! DO NOT DISTRIBUTE!

What's new in FileCFG?
----------------------

Capacity
--------
	Increased capacity. FileCFG was not able to handle more than 1,500
	areas in its first version. The current limit has been moved to 4,000.
	Even though ProBoard supports up to 10,000 I haven't seen anyone that
	uses all of them. I could increase the limit, but the program will
	then need some additional memory handling which will slow it down
	considerably. It is not very fast as it stands right now due to the
	somewhat inefficient collection routines in TurboVision.

New commands
------------
	Added new processing capabilities:

		* text searching: you can now find areas by specifying a
		  search string. The search is not case-sensitive. Use the 'Find'
		  button to scan the areas, and the 'Next' button to continue
		  scanning from last point. To make a new scan, press 'Find' again
		  (this will always start from the beginning of the list). The
		  search string can appear anywhere in the target area name. If a
		  match is found, the area will be focused in the list window.

		* area jumps. You can now go straight to a specified area by
		  giving the number. Note that the number you enter (press the
		  'Goto' button) will be the number of the area in the list 9which
		  may or may not be the same as the visual number: the two will be
		  equal after renumbering, though).

		* global changes. You can change a lot of settings globally now.
		  Like access flags, levels, free and copy local toggles, all
		  groups, and file location and listings. Note that the last two
		  can be somewhat tricky. You can either change the drive for the
		  group of areas (very useful and often needed), or you can change
		  the drive and the root directory for the area (or the list file
		  pathname). The second option will simply use the new drive and
		  path you specify and _append_ the old path information. For
		  example, if you have this: 'D:\FDB\FILES\LISTS.BBS', and and you
		  enter this: 'D:\BBS', then the new entry will be the result of
		  the two strings: 'D:\BBS\FDB\FILES\LISTS.BBS'. You can omit the
		  trialing backslash in the specification. No error checking will
		  be performed.


File handling
-------------
	Improved file handling safety. FileCFG will now check for the presence
	of an old FILECFG.BAK in your ProBoard directory and will offer to
	remove it. You should generally say 'Yes' here or some 'unexpected'
	behavior will occur when you save the modified data. By 'unexpected' I
	mean that FileCFG will always use the .BAK file as a copy of the
	current original when saving data. Since FileCFG does not store
	anything but the area names and numbers in memory, it will need to
	read the original file when saving the modification. If the original
	file was preserved from an old run (and changes have been made), you
	will end up with the modifications applied agianst the old file and
	your current one will be overwritten!!! This is not the case when you
	allow FileCFG to delete the old backup. If you are not sure, you can
	always copy the old backup to another name.

	When applying the global changes, FileCFG will create a FILECFG.BKP
	file. it will be deleted after the processing is complete, but if for
	some reason it is left there, you can safely delete it afterwards.


Cosmetic changes
----------------
	Also, some cosmetic changes have been made. The 'About' box has been
	trimmed down and the background has been changed to normal. The main
	menu will now auto-drop when no box is active on the desktop. Also,
	the menu caption has been changed to read 'File areas' (this is to
	signify that there will be a separate menu for the message areas).


External programs
-----------------
	The file area menu has three slots for external programs. You will
	need to use the SILICON.INI file in your ProBoard system directory to
	enter the commandlines for them. Here's what I have set in my INI
	file:

				[FileCFG]
				Allfix=D:\SBIN\ALLFIX\ASETUP.EXE
				;AllfixMenu=A~l~lfix setup
				FileMgr=D:\SBIN\FEBBS\FEBBS.EXE
				;FileMenu=File area ~m~anager
				AMU=D:\SBIN\AMU\AMUCFG.EXE
				;AMUMenu=AMU ~c~onfiguration

	As you can see, you need to specify the full path to the program and
	the filename (plus extension) too. You can also change the text on the
	menu by uncommenting and editing the *Menu fields. Note that if you
	are willing to use more than one word, you don't need to enclose the
	string in quotation marks (unless you want them badly :-). Surround the
	hotkey desired with the '~' (tilde) character. This key will be
	highlighted on the menu. Make sure you don't have the same hotkey
	defined for more than one menu item.

Removed
-------
	Removed the message area re-arranging. I will add it again as soon as
	the file processing is complete and tested. The message areas turned
	to be tricky and require more thought (for example, we will need to
	reconfigure the reply-to areas if they are defined, and we will need
	to change the hudson message numbers to match the new boards if they
	are changed). The latter is still under consideration.


Comments? Suggestions?
----------------------
	As usual, your comments and suggestions are welcome in the beta echo.
	I just returned from Austin (crazy trip! :) and I have been coding
	all night. It's 6:39a right now and I am heading off to my math
	homework for the 9:00a class. I guess I will get more sleep later. So,
	if anything sliped my mind, I am sorry.. :-)
