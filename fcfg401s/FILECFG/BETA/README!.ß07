THIS IS A CLOSED BETA VERSION! DO NOT DISTRIBUTE!

Note
----
	There have been many changes in the file processing code. Please,
	make a manual backup of your files (FILECFG.PRO and MESSAGES.PB) to a
	separate location before trying this out. It seems to work fine, but I
	haven't had enough time to test the routines thoroughly.

Bug fixes
---------
	Fixed a bug in the 'reply-To' determining when areas were reordered.
	The logic would sometimes fail especially when areas got swapped with
	the 'reply-to' ones.

Functional changes
------------------
	Added individual file area editing! Now you don't have to leave FileCFG
	for anything related to editing file and message areas! I plan to make
	the group selection even better (with a list of groups to select from,
	not remembering stupid numbers). Note that when you select 'Yes' to the
	update prompts, the data will be immediately saved to the original
	file. A couple of nifty things to note in the individual editor:

			(a) the flags selection can be done directly by typing the
				letter/digits when the line is active, or by clicking with
				the mouse in the appropriate character, or by pressing
				Enter and editing in the box that will appear.

			(b) you can use a directory selection dialog box to choose the
				directory name for your file location. Just press Enter
				when the cursor is positioned on the file location input
				line. To change the drive, click on 'Drives'.

			(c) you can use a file selection dialog box to choose the file
				listing name. Just press Enter when the cursor is
				positioned on the file listing input line. Note that you
				can switch drives too, just type the character of the
				drive, followed by a colon (D:) in the input box. You will
				be able to switch to that drive and browse the directories
				there.

	Replaced C-in-C++ code with straight C++ (now FileCFG uses file
	streams as defined in <fstream.h> instead of the old <stdio.h> C
	versions. I am not sure this is a significant improvement, but the
	code looks like C++ even more. :-)

	Because of the above editing function, the 'Quit' button is gone. It
	has been replaced by the 'Edit' button. To quit, you can simply press
	Escape or click on the rectangle in the upper left corner of the box.

Projects for next beta
