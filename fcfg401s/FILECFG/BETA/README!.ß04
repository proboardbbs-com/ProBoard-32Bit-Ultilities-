THIS IS A CLOSED BETA VERSION! DO NOT DISTRIBUTE!
(I hope this is the final beta before the release!)

Functional changes
------------------

	Enabled global changes in the message area editor. Now you can change
	read, write, and sysop level and flags. You can also change the all
	groups flag, the 'kill after' values, and the maximum messages.

	Added the 'max files' and 'max kb' to the global change options in the
	file area editor.

	Added ability to change the sysop name and default origin line in the
	message area editor.

	Added the ability to change the message base type, kind and format.

	Added the ability to change the name options for the area.

	Added the ability to change the system AKA for range of areas. This
	function reads your ProBoard configuration to find out your AKAs.

	Added a new keyword to the SILICON.INI file (this is intended for
	the BlueWave setup for my configuration):

			[FileCFG]
			BlueWave=D:\SBIN\BWAVE\BWSETUP.EXE
			BWmenu=~B~lueWave Setup

	Please, refer to readme!.á02 for the proper format of these entries.
	This menu item will appear in the message editor menu, where InterEcho
	is right now.
