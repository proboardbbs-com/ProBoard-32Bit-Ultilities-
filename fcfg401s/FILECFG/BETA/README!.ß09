THIS IS A CLOSED BETA VERSION! DO NOT DISTRIBUTE!

Note
----
	Backup your current file and message group files (MGROUPS.PB and
	FGROUPS.PB). This version allows manipulation of the groups too!

Functional changes
------------------
	Added file and message groups arranging and editing. You can rearrange,
	insert and delete file and message groups freely. When you save the new
	data, FileCFG will prompt you to update the group definitions in the
	areas with the new values too. You don't have to worry about anything,
	just select 'Yes' and your areas will automatically be updated to the
	new group values. If you delete a group, all areas that belonged to it,
	will have the group field set to 0. As far as I know, FileCFG is the
	only one that supports group editing and auto-updates! You can also
	change group level and/or flags globally.

	Removed the 'Run ProCFG File/Message Area Editor' commands from the
	menus. They are no longer needed since FileCFG allows editing of areas
	and groups internally now. The 'Run ProCFG' command is still available
	in the System menu, though.

Cosmetic changes
----------------
	If for some reason FileCFG cannot find some of the files it needs in
	the ProBoard directory (no groups, for example), the corresponsing
	items on the menus will be disabled.

	The flag selection now is more consistent with the TurboVision colors.
	The background is now blue and the reverse background is green. Looks
	a lot better.

	Fixed 'External program' to read 'External programs' in the message
	editing menu.

	Renamed the 'File areas' menu to read 'Files'. This is now consistent
	with the ability to manipulate not only areas but groups too. Did the
	same to 'Message areas' which is now 'Messages'.

Bugs and future plans
---------------------
	There's something weird: the backspace key is not recognized! :(

	I will add the message area editor in the next version! How do
	you like the features.

Comments? Suggestions?

	As usual, your comments and suggestions are welcome in the beta echo.
