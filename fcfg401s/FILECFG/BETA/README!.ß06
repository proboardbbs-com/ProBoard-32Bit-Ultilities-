THIS IS A CLOSED BETA VERSION! DO NOT DISTRIBUTE!
(ok, yet another bug squashed, this is thanks to a post by Arthur Stark.
The internal reindexing for the file/message base was screwed up.)

Functional changes
------------------
	Fixed a severe bug in the re-indexing functions. FileCFG would not
	correctly swap out to run the indexing. This was due to the midnight
	frenzy of changes in beta 3 and slipped unnoticed until now. Thanks to
	Arthur. I really need to be more careful next time.

Comments? Suggestions?
----------------------
	As usual, your comments and suggestions are welcome in the beta echo.
