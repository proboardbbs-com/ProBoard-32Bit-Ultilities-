THIS IS A CLOSED BETA VERSION! DO NOT DISTRIBUTE!

If there aren't any severe bugs (any bugs!) this will be the finalized
version of FileCFG ready for distribution. I am swamped with school
projects right now (FileCFG kept me busy and I am behind on all my lab
assignments), so I hope this will be the release version. If I don't
hear about any bugs within 5 days of the release, I will unleash it
to the masses! :-)

We've come a long way with FileCFG!

Note
----
	I forgot to mention this in the previous betas, but FileCFG will
	not perform and checking on the message area numbers when you
	renumber or re-arrange them. It is your responsibility (or you can
	run ChkPRO) to make sure, for example, that no Hudson area number
	exceeds 200. FileCFG will not renumber Hudson areas. The reason
	is that ProBoard actually keeps two numbers for the Hudson areas:
	one is the Hudson message base number and the other is the ProBoard
	message area number. These should usually be the same, but I guess
	it is also possible to have them different. That is why FileCFG does
	not mess with them. Changing the number of the Hudson area would also
	mean renumbering all the messages in the messagebase! I guess this is
	exactly what the second number avoids doing! I would also guess that
	the limitation to have Hudson areas numbers less than 200 applies only
	when the message area is created. Once this is done (and the true
	Hudson base number is stored), it can be moved anywhere (and the number
	will remain the same). These are all my thoughts on the subject.. and
	don't quote me on this!

Functional changes
------------------
	Finally implemented the message area editor. Now you can edit individual
	message areas, just like in ProCFG. However, some major conveniences
	have been added: like ability to pick groups from a list instead of
	just typing numbers. FileCFG also makes editable two fields that are
	not available in ProCFG, the minimum age required to access the area
	and the Hudson message board number. You are strongly advised to use
	the Hudson number with extreme caution. Unless you know what you are
	doing, do not change that number. This, of course, applies to Hudson
	areas only. For the others, this number is ignored.

Cosmetic changes and bug fixes
------------------------------
	Fixed some of the status line hints. Now more informative.

	Found anf fixed the stupid bug that would cause the backspace key not
	to be recognized in the input lines. I don't even want to say what
	kind of error it was (ashamed of myself :-)

	Found and fixed a bug that would sometimes cause a random heapcheck()
	assertion failure of the program (was due to a PB-Lib function name
	conflicting with TurboVision, my function behaved differently than the
	one they have, but TV expected the behavior of the other one. I just
	renamed mine).
