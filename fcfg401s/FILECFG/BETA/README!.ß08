THIS IS A CLOSED BETA VERSION! DO NOT DISTRIBUTE!


Functional changes
------------------
	Now when you press enter on the group selection in the individual
	file area editor, you will get a list of all currently defined
	groups where and you can select from this list. This is a lot
	easier than remembering all those numbers. :-)

	By the way, the minAge field in the file area editor is not
	available in ProCFG! I am not sure ProBoard respects it, but
	it is in the file area definition, so I decided to include it.

Cosmetic changes
----------------
	Changed the drop-indicator to a big arrow (does it look better?).
	Now enter drops down the selection boxes instead of down arrow.
	This makes it a lot easier to navigate through the dialog box.

Bug and future plans
--------------------
	There's something weird: the backspace key is not recognized! :(

	I will add the message area editor in the next version! How do
	you like the features.

Comments? Suggestions?
----------------------
	As usual, your comments and suggestions are welcome in the beta echo.
