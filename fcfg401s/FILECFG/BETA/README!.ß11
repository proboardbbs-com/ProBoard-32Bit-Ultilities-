THIS IS A CLOSED BETA VERSION! DO NOT DISTRIBUTE!

Fixed an error when a record is added and edit is selected, the numbers
were all wrong. Now you have to save to disk before editing (after you
add records).

Added the online help system. Check it out.

Added an overlaid version - it is a lot slower, but requires a lot less
memory. So, the choice is yours. It will not be distributed with the
whole package, but it will be made available in a separate archive. To
use the online help with it, rename the FILECFG.HLP to whatever the name
of the executable is (FILECFGX.HLP for example).

Refined the status line hints too.

Any more ideas?
